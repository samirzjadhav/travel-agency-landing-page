### Travel agency landing page

I created this landing page on [Day 2](https://github.com/samirzjadhav/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md#day-2-april-28-2022-thursday) of #100DaysOfCodeChallenge
It was really fun to take [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/17715259-Hilling-Travel-Agency-Landing-Page) and convert it to code and see it live.
